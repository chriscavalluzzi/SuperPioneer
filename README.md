# Super Pioneer
A super-powered player movement mod for Satisfactory. Sprint at the speed of sound and jump over mountains!

## Features
### 🏃‍♀️ Super Sprint
Hold down the Super Sprint key (Caps Lock by default) to sprint _REAL_ fast.

### 🦘 Super Jump
Hold down the jump button to charge your jump, then release it to jump super high!

### 🔧 Customization
These features can be heavily customized (or disabled) from the in-game menu: Pause Menu → Mod Configs → SuperPioneer

### 🌐 Multiplayer
Multiplayer sessions are supported. Movement and animations look natural, and each player can have their own settings.

## Requirements
- If you don't download this mod through Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM), then you must have [Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ManualInstallDirections.html) installed.
- In multiplayer sessions, the host and **all** clients must have the mod installed.

## Known Issues
- By default, Super Sprint is initially bound to the Caps Lock key. Some systems (due to hardware or software conflicts) are unable to send Spacebar inputs while Caps Lock is being held, which prevents the ability to jump while Super Sprinting. As a workaround, you can change the Super Sprint keybinding at: Options → Keybindings → Super Sprint
- When jumping out of water, the player will sometimes perform a fully-charged jump, even if the player hadn't charged it.
- If you turn the max sprint speed setting all the way up and start running around, you may encounter level geometry that is still loading. However, this rarely causes major issues, and I have only died from this once (by accidentally sprinting directly into an unloaded cave).
