## Installation
### Option 1: Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM)
1. If you haven't already, download and install [Satisfactory Mod Manager](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModManager/releases/latest).
2. In the mod manager, search for Super Pioneer and install it. You can also go to the mod's page on [Satisfactory Mod Repository (SMR)](https://ficsit.app/mod/SuperPioneer) and go to Versions ‚Üí Install.
3. If you're going to be playing in multiplayer sessions, make sure everyone has the mod installed (both host and clients).

### Option 2: Manual Install
1. Download and install [Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ManualInstallDirections.html).
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/chriscavalluzzi/SuperPioneer/releases/latest) of this mod.
1. Create a folder called `SuperPioneer` inside `<game root>\FactoryGame\Mods`.
1. Extract the contents of the mod file into this folder. If you did it correctly, there should be a file called `SuperPioneer.uplugin` in the folder `<game root>\FactoryGame\Mods\SuperPioneer`.
1. If you're going to be playing in multiplayer sessions, make sure everyone has the mod installed (both host and clients).

## Known Issues
- By default, Super Sprint is initially bound to the Caps Lock key. Some systems (due to hardware or software conflicts) are unable to send Spacebar inputs while Caps Lock is being held, which prevents the ability to jump while Super Sprinting. As a workaround, you can change the Super Sprint keybinding at: Options ‚Üí Keybindings ‚Üí Super Sprint
- If you turn the max sprint speed setting all the way up and start running around, you may encounter level geometry that is still loading. However, this rarely causes major issues, and I have only died from this once (by accidentally sprinting directly into an unloaded cave).
